Save translation file
=====================

This module was written for **developpers** to easily generate i18n files (.po and .pot) from the list of modules,
instead of using the native configuration "Export Translation" wizard.

- The i18n subdirectory is created if missing in the module.
- A ".po" file is generated for each installed languages.
- If a ".po" file exists it is **overwritten** (use with caution).
